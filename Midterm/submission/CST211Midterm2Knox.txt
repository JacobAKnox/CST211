3. 
The first error I fixed was on like 51, in the implmentation of the default constructor.
It did not initilize the root to mullptr, causeing the the insert function to try to access
unititlized memory.
I added ': m_root(nullptr)' to the default constructor.

The second error was in the move and copy constructors. 
They again did not initilize the root to nullptr, causing the purge function to try to access 
unititlized memory. 

The final error was with the pre, post, and in order traversal functions.
None of them traversed to the left at all. I added a recursive call to the left child in each
of the functions.
